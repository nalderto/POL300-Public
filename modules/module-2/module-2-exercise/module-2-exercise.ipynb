In the example above, we have to do a range `1:3`, because we want to start with `\"Adams\"` \\(index 1\\) and end with `\"Jefferson\"` \\(index 2\\). Remember, we start counting with 0 in Python.

For example, maybe we want to iterate through a data structure \\(like a list\\), or perhaps we want to continue running a piece of code until a condition is met. It is during these circumstance where we use _loops_. There are two types of loops in Python `for` and `while`.\n",

        "* `print(i)` will print the value of `i` which was declared in the loop header.  Recall that the loop variable could be named nearly anything.  If the variable was named `number`, then we would have used `print(number)`.  As the loop progresses, the value of `i` changes to each of the corresponding values in the data structure specified \\(`range(4)` in this instance\\). **Please note that the loop body is indented from the loop header, this is required**\n",
